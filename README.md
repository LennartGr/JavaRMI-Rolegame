Playable on the console.

- Start the server first with **`java -jar target/server-rolegame.jar`**.

- Run **`java -jar target/client-rolegame.jar`** for each client. 

The file **`target/rolegame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`** can be ignored.

## Partition of work
The code was written in some sessions of pair programming, so all work was done together.
